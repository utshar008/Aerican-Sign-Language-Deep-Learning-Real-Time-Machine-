# Aerican-Sign-Language-Deep-Learning-Real-Time-Machine-
Ahed To My Thesis Work.
Step-1:Make Dataset with data.py and save to Data folder.
Step-2:
      i.Preprocess The Data(Augmentation)
      ii.Select and Train The model.(Necessary Layer Composition)
      iii.Save the keras model (asl.keras)
      iv.Detect The Sign Language in realtime mood with test.py.
      
In conclision ,It is an arbitary form of work  starting my deep learning journey. The Accuracy was about  94%.The letters werw detected with good accuracy .Thank You.
